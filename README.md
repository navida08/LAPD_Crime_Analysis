# LAPD_Crime_Analysis

Our project, titled Digging Into Crime in LA, is the analysis of crime data in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2023. The primary objective of this project is to extract meaningful patterns, trends, and insights from the data that can inform various stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, city planners, and the general public. It is particularly focused on investigating the impact of California's high spending on policing and corrections on crime rates in LA. We are leveraging a dataset that includes information about grant funding from the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles. This dataset provides insights into the financial resources allocated for security and law enforcement in the city, crime-prone geographic areas, premises associated with reported crimes, and an assessment of the effectiveness of preventive initiatives.
